task 7
In this task, I connected Python to a SQLite database (sales_data.db) using the sqlite3 module.
I created a sales table with sample data including product names, quantities, and prices.
Then, I ran a basic SQL query to calculate the total quantity sold and total revenue for each product using the GROUP BY clause.
The results were loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and printed using the print() function.
Finally, I used matplotlib to create a simple bar chart showing revenue by product, and saved it as an image file.
This task helped practice basic SQL, data analysis with Pandas, and data visualization using Python.
